# ShowdownCore

A library meant to connect several plugins without complicated dependencies

Featurs:

- ItemStack Registry
- Custom Enchantment Creation (assuming there's a valid datapack named ssmp, the plugin currently doesnt change tags or add pack.mcmeta)
- Enchantment Registry (and easy conversion to Bukkit Enchantment)
- Functin Registry (returns any type and accepts arguments)
